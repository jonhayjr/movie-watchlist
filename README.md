# Movie Watchlist

With this app, a user can search for movie that is pulled from an api and then add that movie to their watchlist.  Watchlist movies are saved in local storage.  Movie data is pulled from 'The OMDB API'.  This is a project from Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path.

I built this using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
